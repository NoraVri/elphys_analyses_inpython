# notes summary:
# actually has some spont.fastevents early on in the recording, and responds to light with something fast always
# - even when baselineV is hyperpolarized all the way to -90mV.
# Resting baselineV goes from -50 to -60mV in the first 10 minutes of recording, then depolarizes slowly over the
# next 20 minutes back to -50mV until the last two traces where it suddenly leaves.
# Interestingly, the largest of the fastevents seem to have an AHP as well - I think this may be a network-effect though,
# because the normalized waveform of these events (which occur at more depolarized baselineV) is slightly wider than of
# events without AHP, and because looking in the raw data I can see the neuron trying to do a few cycles of oscillating
# after certain fastevents. So, I think it's because these evoked an AP in a coupled neuron.

# neat_events = ~((des_df.file_origin == 'light_0010.abf') & (des_df.segment_idx >= 3))
# adding the neatevents-series to the depolarizing_events-df:
