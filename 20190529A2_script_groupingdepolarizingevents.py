# very unstable recording, yet despite fluctuating baselineV and other noisiness it is very clear that this neuron
# has lots of fastevents in multiple amplitudes, especially during the last ~2minutes of recording where neuron
# suddenly depolarizes a bunch (and then dies soon after). No light activations.

# looks like the default parameters worked great - this neuron definitely also has quite a few events in the range
# up to 2mV amp, but from seeing those in the raw data they are all spikelets. Larger things start at amp ~4mV and
# stand out from the baseline beautifully, and all seem to have gotten picked up real nice by the algorithm.
# Still, let's see them before deciding that they are all fastevents:

# indeed, these are all fastevents: amps ~3.5 - 10mV, rise-time < 1ms and nicely identical normalized waveform.
# Labeling them as such:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[events_underinvestigation, 'event_label'] = 'fastevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# Though the fastevents look pretty neat, the recording itself does not: starts at a baselineV of barely -30mV,
# then improves some but only until it suddenly gets a stroke with tons of fastevents fired as it depolarizes and dies.
# All in all, I don't think this neuron's data should be included in the 'neat' pile.
