# notes summary:
# just a single gapFree trace just under 4min. long; neuron has nothing going on spontaneously,
# depolarizing current pulses elicit APs.


# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# extracting with default parameters for finding large depolarizing events in light-activated neurons:
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# The three APs evoked by smaller depolarizing current pulses come just too long after currentpulsechange to be
# automatically labeled as such, but they are definitely evoked by it. The others all got picked up properly.
# Re-labeling accordingly:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[aps_spont, 'event_label'] = 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# No ttl applied for this neuron.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# blocknames = des_df[unlabeled_spont_events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# the single 'event' that got picked up is a noise-thing sitting on depolarizing current pulse.
# Labeling it as such:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'noiseevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
