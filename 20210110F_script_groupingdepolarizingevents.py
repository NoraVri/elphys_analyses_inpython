# notes summary:
# pretty nice recording, though neuron not really doing anything interesting spontaneously.

# %% plotting light-evoked activity:
singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatatraces_ttlaligned()


# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# light- and DC-evoked APs got picked up nicely; no spont.APs recorded in this neuron
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# light responses are often just a bit <2mV, but otherwise got picked up nicely; did not see anything labeled that is in fact spont.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# just two events got picked up, and they're both T-type Ca-peaks caused by release from -DC.
# Labeling them as currentpulsechange:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'currentpulsechange'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# up to and including the first half of light_0001 there is no real sign of recording quality deteriorating (hard
# to tell though cause no spont.events or APs seen most of that time). However, that's barely 7 minutes of recording
# altogether in which the neuron doesn't do anything interesting spontaneously anyway, so I see
# no reason to add neatevents.
