# notes summary:
# a little indecisive about its baselineV at first (just like its pair), but then settles for a quite steady run of
# light-applications. Light easily evokes AP and practically always seems to evoke something fast, even when neuron
# is hyperpolarized quite far. No spontaneous events whatsoever (but +DC does evoke APs).

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:

# no spont.APs recorded; APs on currentpulses and evoked by light all got picked up quite nicely.

# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events

# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# looks like all light-evoked responses got picked up quite nicely (including baseline-points); definitely
# nothing that is in fact spontaneous got labeled as evoked.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# not a single spontaneous event got picked up - indeed I saw none in the raw data.

# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# though a little unsteady at first, this neuron has some very nice steady behavior for quite a while during light
# applications (baselineV ~-50mV, AP amp 84-90mV); it then starts to go off a bit over the course of prolonged -DC
# (to see effect of hyperpolarization on evoking APs, which is quite profound).
# neat_events = (singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.file_origin.str.contains('light')
#                & (singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.file_origin.str.contains('0000|1|2|3')))
