# neuron doing practically nothing besides one spont.AP and baselineV: no response to light
# or any spont.activity really, though it does clearly have active currents (seen in response to DC)

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events

# two APs got labeled spont. but only one of them is; the other is evoked by rebound from hyperpolarization. Labeling as such:
# ap_oncp = (aps_spont & (des_df.peakv_idx < (20000 * 250)))
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[ap_oncp, 'event_label'] = 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
# DC-evoked APs all got picked up quite nicely; no light-evoked APs in this neuron.

# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# no evoked events labeled; unsurprising given that there aren't any. Nothing spontaneous got labeled either.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# no real events got picked up, just noise-things; indeed I did not see any events.

# singleneuron_data.plot_depolevents(unlabeled_spont_events,
#                                    colorby_measure='baselinev',

# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# I see no reason to mark neatevents for this neuron: it isn't really doing anything at all spontaneously or in response
# to light, and even though baselineV just below -40mV the total lack of other activity (spont. or evoked) makes it
# difficult to judge the quality of this neuron's recording.
