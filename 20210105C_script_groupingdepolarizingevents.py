# notes summary:
# quite nice recording: neuron oscillating throughout at pretty steady baselineV; however,
# nothing much else of interesting spontaneous activity. Light response seems to engage T-type a lot.

# %% plotting light-evoked activity:
singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatatraces_ttlaligned()



# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# APs on currentpulsechanges all got picked up nicely; no other kinds of APs recorded in this neuron.
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# inasmuch as there was a response to light it usually got picked up; did not see anything labeled that should in fact be spont.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# just 2 events picked up altogether, but those are definitely not fastevents: rise-time ~5ms, and neuron
# stays depolarized for quite a while after. So, no fastevents to label in this neuron.

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# neuron has more or less steady baselineV for most of the recording, but very little else to judge recording quality by (no spont.APs or fastevents) so I'm not labeling 'neat-events' for this neuron.
