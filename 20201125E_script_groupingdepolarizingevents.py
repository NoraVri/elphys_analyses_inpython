# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# all light responses got picked up as such, and nothing got labeled that shouldn't.

# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse

# a handful of events all got picked up, as well as a couple of other things.
# In gapFree_0000 the 'event' with high baselineV is in fact a currentpulsechange:
# currentpulsechange = (unlabeled_spont_events & (des_df.baselinev > -25))

# In the remaining events there is one that stands out for being the smallest one with the slowest rise-time; with
# amplitude 3.5mV it's particularly giant for a spikelet, but I honestly think it's that. Labeling all the rest as
# fastevents:
# fastevents = (unlabeled_spont_events & (des_df.rise_time_20_80 < 1))
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[fastevents, 'event_label'] = 'fastevent'

# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# not marking neat events for this neuron: with baselineV > -40mV from the start it's never a very good-looking recording.
