# neuron is practically dead: resting baselineV ~-8mV and practically no spont.activity;
# yet it responds to light quite consistently, occasionally even with what looks like a fastevent

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)

# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont

# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,

# one AP on currentpulsechange got picked up; no other APs recorded in this neuron (DC pulses to see spikes not applied).
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# just 2 light responses got picked up; the rest are <2mV amp. No spont.events got labeled as evoked.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# just one event got picked up; it has amp ~3.5mV and rise-time 1.1ms, very borderline for fastevent... But I
# did see some smaller events in the raw data that are definitely spikelets and have very different shape,
# so I'll go ahead and take this one to be a fastevent. Labeling as such:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'fastevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# This neuron is more dead than alive from the start of recording, so no reason to include it in the neat pile.
