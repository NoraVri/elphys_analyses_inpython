# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# although osc.amp is clearly going steadily down over the course of recording, I see no reason not to include it in
# neatevents: baselineV is steady with mean ~-45mV, and APs have amplitude of almost 100mV. Marking the entire (<3min.)
# recording as 'neat':
# neatevents = ~singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.file_origin.isna()
# # adding the neatevents-series to the depolarizing_events-df:
# neat_events.name = 'neat_event'
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.join(neat_events)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
