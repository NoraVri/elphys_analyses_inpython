# notes summary:
# not a great recording: neuron has resting baselineV ~-35mV on break-in and deteriorates from there; gets held with
# -1nA DC for a lot of the time. Mostly doesn't repond to light (except once with a 3.5mV fast event), and doesn't
# really exhibit any interesting activity spontaneously.

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# DC-evoked APs got picked up; no other kinds of APs recorded in this neuron.
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# the one evoked event that got elicited got picked up; no other events labeled.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# the only 'events' that got picked up are peaks of a small bout of oscillations; labeling these as 'noiseevents':
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_events, 'event_label'] = 'noiseevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# neuron half-dead from the start, not keeping good baselineV or showing much of any interesting activity spontaneously,
# so I see no reason to label neat events.
