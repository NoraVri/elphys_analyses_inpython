# notes summary:
# Neuron with some nice light responses and nothing much else really besides a resting voltage.

# %% plotting light-evoked activity:
singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatatraces_ttlaligned()

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,
#                                          segments_overlayed=False)
# no spont.APs in this neuron; a single light-evoked AP and some APs riding +DC pulses early on in the recording
# all got picked up nicely.
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# not all light responses are >2mV, but those that are all got picked up; definitely
# nothing that is in fact spont. got labeled as evoked.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# No actual spont.events got picked up, just noise-things occurring as the cell dies at the end of recordings.
# Labeling 'events' accordingly:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'noiseevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# Cell has baselineV ~-25mV on break-in, and it regains itself nicely (~-40mV resting V for most of recording) but
# doesn't display any interesting behavior spontaneously, so I see no reason to include this neuron's data in the neat-pile.
# On reconsideration of evokedAPs, still not marking them as neat: baselineV barely reaches <-40mV most of the time
# and is on the whole too unsteady to call this recording 'neat'.
