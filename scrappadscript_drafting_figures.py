## for the paper: two examples
# events with clearly identical normalized waveform
# different numbers of amplitude groups in the two examples, and the distance between the peaks in the amp.histogram
# should be different across the two neurons.

# statistics
# - #neurons analyzed, distribution of the number of different amplitude groups per neuron
#       - #amplitude groups at hyperpolarized baselinev
