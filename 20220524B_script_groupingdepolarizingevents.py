# >1hr recording with super interesting oscillations; not sure about events getting blocked by QX though (mostly
# because there don't seem to be any from the start, and spikePulse protocol was not carried out at varying holding levels).

#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
