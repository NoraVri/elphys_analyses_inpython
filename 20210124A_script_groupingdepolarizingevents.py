# notes summary:
# this neuron has LOADS of fast-events, and gets held with DC current to see baselinev effect on frequency
# has small, wacky oscillations off and on, should be interesting to see if that correlates with fast-events somehow

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
