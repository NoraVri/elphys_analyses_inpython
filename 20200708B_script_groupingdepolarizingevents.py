# notes summary:
# Quite nice recording, with some spont.APs and fastevents of all sorts of amplitudes occurring spontaneously, and
# light applications usually eliciting something fast

# %% plotting light-evoked activity
singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatatraces_ttlaligned()

# %% !note: Any code written below is meant just for telling the story of selecting out the fast-events,
#   and cannot simply be uncommented and run to get exactly the saved results (the console has to be re-initialized
#   after each call to write_results, and maybe other things).
# %% extracting depolarizing events
# notes:
# extracting with default parameter settings except min_depolamp=2 and ttleffect_window=15

# singleneuron_data.get_depolarizingevents_fromrawdata(min_depolamp=2, ttleffect_window=15)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

# %% plots and analyses: labeling actionpotentials
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# aps_oncurrentpulsechange = des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential_on_currentpulsechange'
# aps_evokedbylight = ((des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (des_df.applied_ttlpulse))
# aps_spont = (des_df.event_label == 'actionpotential') & (~des_df.applied_ttlpulse)
# # for each category of APs, see that they are indeed that:
# events = aps_oncurrentpulsechange #aps_evokedbylight  #aps_spont
# blocknames = des_df[events].file_origin.unique()
# if len(blocknames) > 0:
#     singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(*blocknames,
#                                          events_to_mark=events,

# The three light-evoked and two spont.APs all got picked up nicely (no DC pulses for evoking spikes applied)
# %% plots and analyses: seeing and labeling subthreshold depolarizing events
# des_df = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events
# nbins = 100
# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# inasmuch as responses are >2mV they all got picked up; definitely nothing that is in fact spont got picked up as evoked.

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# looks like all spont.events that got picked up may be fastevents.
# Let's see them:
# singleneuron_data.plot_depolevents(unlabeled_spont_events,
#                                    colorby_measure='baselinev',
#                                    plotwindow_inms=15,
#                                    do_baselining=True,
#                                    # do_normalizing=True,
#                                    plot_dvdt=True
#                                    )
# indeed, those are all fastevents: amp 2-11mV, fast rise-times, identical normalized decays except getting a bit
# wider with hyperpolarization. Labeling them as such:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'fastevent'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# Quite nice recording really, I see no signs of deterioration until the final light block.
# Marking everything else as 'neat':
# neat_events = ~(des_df.file_origin == 'light_0001.abf')
# # adding the neatevents-series to the depolarizing_events-df:
# neat_events.name = 'neat_event'
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events = singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.join(neat_events)
# singleneuron_data.write_results()
