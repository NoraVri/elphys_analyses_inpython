# quick-and-dirty analysis steps:
# import data, cleanup where necessary (i.e., remove channels not belonging to neuron and/or any any sections recorded in the wrong mode)
# identify unique recording conditions (temperature, drug) and collect all files per condition
# per condition, pick a 30s trace to get numbers from and (manually) place these in excel table

## importing the data
neuron_name = '20250410A1'
neuron_data = SingleNeuron(neuron_name)
# neuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks()

# notes on raw data:


# raw data cleanups
# removing recording channel not belonging to this neuron:
# blocknameslist = neuron_data.get_blocknames(printing='off')
# for blockname in blocknameslist:
#     neuron_data.rawdata_remove_nonrecordingchannel(blockname, 2, pairedrecording=True)
