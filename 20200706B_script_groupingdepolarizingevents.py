# notes summary:
# not a great recording: after the first 3 minutes or so neuron seems to lose its ability to make full Na-APs, and
# the things that should be APs look more like dendritic calcium spikes (broad round depolarizations with peakV ~0mV).
# Light responses seem similarly affected, but they are usually quite fast and large in amplitude nonetheless.
# !may need to exclude non-neat data altogether, because it's so ambiguous what's going on there.
