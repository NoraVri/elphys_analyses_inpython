# notes summary:
# not a great recording at all: resting baselineV ~-20mV at the start and deteriorating; didn't see the cell do anything
# interesting spontaneously but it does respond to light with spikelets and/or fastevents.

# light responses > 2mV all got picked up, and with pretty good baseline-points, too

# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# not marking neatevents for this neuron: terrible baselineV, no APs recorded at all, no ongoing spontaneous activity.
