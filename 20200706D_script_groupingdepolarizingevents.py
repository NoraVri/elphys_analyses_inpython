# Seeing that light/puff-evoked things all got labeled as such:
# evoked_events = des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks('light', events_to_mark=evoked_events)
# notes:
# not all light-evoked events got picked up - not surprising given that their amp is right ~2mV.
# Definitely nothing that is in fact spont. got picked up as evoked. Cell stops responding to light altogether during the final block (light#2).

# Seeing that spontaneous fast-events got picked up:
# spont_events = ~des_df.applied_ttlpulse
# unlabeled_events = des_df.event_label.isna() # all events that were not automatically given a label
# unlabeled_spont_events = (spont_events & unlabeled_events)
# singleneuron_data.plot_rawdatablocks(events_to_mark=unlabeled_spont_events, segments_overlayed=False)
# notes:
# the only things that got picked up are in fact currentpulsechanges. Labeling them as such:
# singleneuron_data.depolarizing_events.loc[unlabeled_spont_events, 'event_label'] = 'currentpulsechange'
# singleneuron_data.write_results()

#### -- this concludes sorting through all sub-threshold events and labeling them -- ####
# %% marking 'neat' events: events occurring during stable and 'good-looking' periods of recording
# between the high resting baselineV and noise-level variability, and the fact that not a single fastevent was seen
# I don't think there's any reason to include any of this neuron's data in the neat-pile.
